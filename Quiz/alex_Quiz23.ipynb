We'll start out by working with the `matplotlib` package, which, at least for the time being, remains the workhorse plotting package in Python. As we'll see later, many other Python plotting tools are built on top of matplotlib, so even in cases where you're not *explicitly* interacting with your plots through matplotlib, there's a good chance you're doing so implicitly.\n",

    "Matplotlib is a very rich package. One of its notable features is that it provides plotting interfaces at both high and low levels. At the high level, matplotlib's pyplot module includes [a large number of functions](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html) that can construct common types of plots in a single call. We've already seen the `plot()` and `scatter()` functions, which by default produce line plots and scatter plots, respectively. But matplotlib also has things like `bar()`, `contour()`, `hist()`, and `hlines()`, which respectively produce bar plots, contour plots, histograms, and horizontal lines. It also has support for less common plots--some of which are widely used in specific domains of analysis--like `barbs()`, `hexbin()`, `magnitude_spectrum()`, and so on. For example:"

    "## Composing multi-plot figures\n",
    "So far we've only dealt with figures that have a single plot. But it's very common to want to construct more complex figures made up of multiple panels--often in irregular arrangements (e.g., a single left column, and a right column broken up into 3 separate cells). Matplotlib provides a variety of tools for working with multi-plot layouts. Here we'll illustrate a couple of the more accessible ones. In general, we can think of a `Figure` in matplotlib as a container for one or more `Axes` objects, where the position of the `Axes` in relation to the `Figure` is specified when the former is attached to the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first consider the case where we're working with a regular layout--meaning, we want to divide our figure into a fixed number of rows and/or columns. Say we want to generate the same basic plot for multiple discrete groups or bins of data. The easiest way to deal with this kind of situation in matplotlib is using the `subplots()` function. We'll take a look at `subplots()` in a moment; but before we do that, let's start looking at some real data, instead of working with random numbers. We'll use the `load_dataset` utility in a plotting library called `seaborn` to import the famous \"iris\" dataset:"

    "**Observation:** \n",
    "The boxplot of sepal length by species reveals several key insights. Most notably, it highlights that Iris setosa consistently exhibits shorter sepal lengths compared to Iris versicolor and Iris virginica, whose medians are noticeably higher. The relatively narrow interquartile range for setosa suggests a more uniform sepal size within that species, while the wider ranges observed for versicolor and virginica indicate greater variability. Outliers present in the data further hint at individual specimens that deviate from the norm, potentially warranting further investigation.\n",
